# Paintings detection
This is a project for the exam of Computer Vision. Its aim is to find a good approach to recognize paintings hanging on a wall of an art gallery from an image or a video, to then being able to rectify them and finally to match each one to the paintings in a given database. The material we worked on is a set of videos taken from the Galleria Estense in Modena. 
Two different approaches are taken: one based on image processing techniques and one based on deep learning and on CNNs in particular.
